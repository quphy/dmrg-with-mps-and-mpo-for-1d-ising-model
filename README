While learning DMRG, I was captivated by the genious design of MPS and MPO within it, and deeply impressed by the magic of tensor network methods represented by DMRG. Therefore, I decided to reproduce the DMRG implementation of MPO and MPS without using other existing tensor network libraries, such as ITensor. I chose the one-dimensional quantum Ising model because its Hamiltonian is simple enough, and the corresponding MPO is known.
Currently, the code has a bug. It can initialize MPS and MPO and provide the energy based on the initialization, but when I sweep, there's a problem leading to SVD decomposition explosion. I have tried to to fix this bug, but without success. That's why I only wrote the initialization process in the main.cpp and not the DMRG loop. Once the bug fixed, It's very easy to write the DMRG loop in the main.cpp.
